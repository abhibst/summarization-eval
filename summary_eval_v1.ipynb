    "\n",
    "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a significant public health concern, and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-Beta) has been recognized as an essential mediator in the genesis of CKD. TGF-Beta is involved in the accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components in the glomeruli and tubular interstitium, leading to glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and renal fibrosis (López-Hernández Francisco J, 2011, CSLY3). This summary will discuss the role of TGF-Beta in various pathological events in CKD.\n",

    "Glomerulosclerosis:\n",
    "TGF-Beta plays a significant role in glomerulosclerosis, which is a major cause of glomerular filtration rate reduction in CKD. TGF-Beta induces podocytopenia caused by podocyte apoptosis and detachment from the glomerular basement membrane, mesangial expansion caused by mesangial cell hypertrophy, proliferation, apoptosis, and ECM synthesis, and endothelial to mesenchymal transition, giving rise to glomerular myofibroblasts (López-Hernández Francisco J, 2011, CSLY3).\n",
    "Tubulointerstitial fibrosis:\n",
    "TGF-Beta is involved in tubulointerstitial fibrosis, one of the hallmark lesions of CKD. TGF-Beta mediates several key tubular pathological events during CKD progression, including fibroblast proliferation, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, tubular and fibroblast ECM production, and epithelial cell death leading to tubular cell deletion and interstitial fibrosis (López-Hernández Francisco J, 2011, CSLY3).\n",
    "Renal fibrosis:\n",
    "TGF-Beta plays a critical role in renal fibrosis, which is a pathological feature of CKD. TGF-Beta has been shown to mediate renal fibrosis, renal parenchyma degeneration, and loss of function associated with CKD (López-Hernández Francisco J, 2011, CSLY3).\n",

    "CSLY1,An integrative view on the role of TGF-beta in the progressive tubular deletion associated with chronic kidney disease.,\"\"No section Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is a cytokine known to participate in several processes related to the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD), including tubular degeneration. This is thought to occur mainly through apoptosis and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of tubule epithelial cells, which give rise to a reduction of the tubular compartment and a scarring-like, fibrotic healing process of the interstitial compartment. In vivo blockade of TGF-beta action has been shown to reduce CKD-associated tubular damage. However, a direct action of TGF-beta on tubule cells is controversial as the underlying mechanism. On the one hand, TGF-beta is known to induce EMT of tubular cells, although its incidence in vivo can hardly explain the extent of the damage. On the other hand, a few publications have reported that TGF-beta induces a mild degree of apoptosis in cultured tubular cells. This most likely reflects the consequence of the cell-cycle arrest rather than a direct pro-apoptotic effect of TGF-beta. The implications of these observations are analyzed in the pathological context, where normal tubular cells do not normally proliferate, but they might divide for repair purposes. Furthermore, renal fibrosis, a TGF-beta-mediated event, is integrated as a potential, indirect effect contributing to tubule deletion.\"\",García-Sánchez Omar,Kidney international,2010-03-24\n",
    "CSLY2,TGF-Beta Signaling in Bone with Chronic Kidney Disease,\"\"No section Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling is not only important in skeletal development, but also essential in bone remodeling in adult bone. The bone remodeling process involves integrated cell activities induced by multiple stimuli to balance bone resorption and bone formation. TGF-β plays a role in bone remodeling by coordinating cell activities to maintain bone homeostasis. However, mineral metabolism disturbance in chronic kidney disease (CKD) results in abnormal bone remodeling, which leads to ectopic calcification in CKD. High circulating levels of humoral factors such as parathyroid hormone, fibroblast growth factor 23, and Wnt inhibitors modulate bone remodeling in CKD. Several reports have revealed that TGF-β is involved in the production and functions of these factors in bone. TGF-β may act as a factor that mediates abnormal bone remodeling in CKD.\"\",Iwasaki Yoshiko,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,2018-08-10\n",
    "CSLY3,\"\"Role of TGF-β in chronic kidney disease: an integration of tubular, glomerular and vascular effects.\"\",\"\"No section Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) has been recognized as an important mediator in the genesis of chronic kidney diseases (CKD), which are characterized by the accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components in the glomeruli (glomerular fibrosis, glomerulosclerosis) and the tubular interstitium (tubulointerstitial fibrosis). Glomerulosclerosis is a major cause of glomerular filtration rate reduction in CKD and all three major glomerular cell types (podocytes or visceral epithelial cells, mesangial cells and endothelial cells) participate in the fibrotic process. TGF-β induces (1) podocytopenia caused by podocyte apoptosis and detachment from the glomerular basement membrane; (2) mesangial expansion caused by mesangial cell hypertrophy, proliferation (and eventually apoptosis) and ECM synthesis; (3) endothelial to mesenchymal transition giving rise to glomerular myofibroblasts, a major source of ECM. TGF-β has been shown to mediate several key tubular pathological events during CKD progression, namely fibroblast proliferation, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, tubular and fibroblast ECM production and epithelial cell death leading to tubular cell deletion and interstitial fibrosis. In this review, we re-examine the mechanisms involved in glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis and the way that TGF-β participates in renal fibrosis, renal parenchyma degeneration and loss of function associated with CKD.\"\",López-Hernández Francisco J,Cell and tissue research,2011-11-22\n",
    "CSLY4,Let-7c-5p Is Involved in Chronic Kidney Disease by Targeting TGF-β Signaling,\"\"No section The purpose of the present study was to investigate the expressions of hsa-let-7c-5p and TGF-β signaling-related molecules and their correlations with clinical characteristics in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Twenty-three biopsy specimens of CKD patients and 20 negative control tissues were selected. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was used for the detection of hsa-let-7c-5p, transforming growth factor β (TGF-β ) and TGF-β receptor type 1 (TGF-β R1) expression levels. Target gene of hsa-let-7c-5p was verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay. A significant decrease of hsa-let-7c-5p expression in CKD tissue was found, compared with that of normal renal tissues (p &lt; 0.01). Expression levels of TGF-β in CKD were increased, compared with that of normal kidney tissue (p &lt; 0.001). The difference in the expression of TGF-β R1 between CKD tissues and normal renal tissues was not significant (p &gt; 0.05). A negative correlation was found between the expression of TGF-β and renal tissue hsa-let-7c-5p levels. Furthermore, hsa-let-7c-5p was identified to regulate TGF- β 1 by directly binding with the 167-173 site in the 3′ untranslated region. Decreased hsa-let-7c-5p levels in CKD patients was found to be associated with disease severity, which shows a negative correlation with proteinuria and creatinine levels, and a positive correlation with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), while relative TGF-β 1 expression had a positive correlation with creatinine level. In summary, changes in hsa-let-7c-5p expression and its target gene TGF-β are associated with the disease status of CKD. Let-7c-5p may contribute to the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis through TGF-β signaling, a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target of the disease.\"\",Wang Zhenguo,BioMed Research International,2020-06-12\n",
    "CSLY5,\"\"Potential targeted therapy and diagnosis based on novel insight into growth factors, receptors, and downstream effectors in acute kidney injury and acute kidney injury-chronic kidney disease progression\"\",\"\"No section Acute kidney injury (AKI) is defined as a rapid decline in renal function and is characterized by excessive renal inflammation and programmed death of resident cells. AKI shows high morbidity and mortality, and severe or repeated AKI can transition to chronic kidney disease (CKD) or even end-stage renal disease (ESRD); however, very few effective and specific therapies are available, except for supportive treatment. Growth factors, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin-like growth factor (IGF), and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), are significantly altered in AKI models and have been suggested to play critical roles in the repair process of AKI because of their roles in cell regeneration and renal repair. In recent years, a series of studies have shown evidence that growth factors, receptors, and downstream effectors may be highly involved in the mechanism of AKI and may function in the early stage of AKI in response to stimuli by regulating inflammation and programmed cell death. Moreover, certain growth factors or correlated proteins act as biomarkers for AKI due to their sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore, growth factors originating from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) via paracrine signaling or extracellular vesicles recruit leukocytes or repair intrinsic cells and may participate in AKI repair or the AKI-CKD transition. In addition, growth factor-modified MSCs show superior therapeutic potential compared to that of unmodified controls. In this review, we summarized the current therapeutic and diagnostic strategies targeting growth factors to treat AKI in clinical trials. We also evaluated the possibilities of other growth factor-correlated molecules as therapeutic targets in the treatment of AKI and the AKI-CKD transition.\"\",Gao Li,Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy,2020-02-14\n",
    "CSLY6,TDAG51 induces renal interstitial fibrosis through modulation of TGF-β receptor 1 in chronic kidney disease,\"\"No section Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by the gradual loss of renal function and is a major public health concern. Risk factors for CKD include hypertension and proteinuria, both of which are associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. ER stress-induced TDAG51 protein expression is increased at an early time point in mice with CKD. Based on these findings, wild-type and TDAG51 knock-out (TDKO) mice were used in an angiotensin II/deoxycorticosterone acetate/salt model of CKD. Both wild-type and TDKO mice developed hypertension, increased proteinuria and albuminuria, glomerular injury, and tubular damage. However, TDKO mice were protected from apoptosis and renal interstitial fibrosis. Human proximal tubular cells were used to demonstrate that TDAG51 expression induces apoptosis through a CHOP-dependent mechanism. Further, a mouse model of intrinsic acute kidney injury demonstrated that CHOP is required for ER stress-mediated apoptosis. Renal fibroblasts were used to demonstrate that TGF-β induces collagen production through an IRE1-dependent mechanism; cells treated with a TGF-β receptor 1 inhibitor prevented XBP1 splicing, a downstream consequence of IRE1 activation. Interestingly, TDKO mice express significantly less TGF-β receptor 1, thus, preventing TGF-β-mediated XBP1 splicing. In conclusion, TDAG51 induces apoptosis in the kidney through a CHOP-dependent mechanism, while contributing to renal interstitial fibrosis through a TGF-β-IRE1-XBP1 pathway.\"\",Carlisle Rachel E.,Cell Death & Disease,2021-10-08\n",
    "CSLY7,Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) is activated by the CtBP2-p300-AP1 transcriptional complex in chronic renal failure,\"\"No section Chronic renal failure (CRF), also known as chronic kidney disease (CKD), is a common renal disorder characterized by gradual kidney dysfunction. Molecular dissection reveals that transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) plays a central role in the pathogenesis of CRF. However, the mechanism underlying TGF-β upregulation has not been demonstrated. Here, we verified that the elevated level of TGF-β was associated with the severity of CRF stages and the activation of TGF-β-mediated signaling in 120 renal biopsies from CRF patients. By analyzing the promoter region of the TGFB1 gene, we identified one AP-1 (activator protein 1) and four NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) binding sites. Knockdown of two AP-1 subunits (c-Jun and c-FOS ) or blockage of AP-1 signaling with two inhibitors T-5224 and SR11302 could cause the downregulation of TGFB1 , whereas knockdown of two NF-κB subunits (p65 and p50 ) or blockage of NF-κB signaling with two inhibitors TPCA1 and BOT-64 could not change the expression of TGFB1. Using mass spectrometry and coimmunoprecipitation analyses, we found that both c-Jun and c-FOS formed a complex with CtBP2 (C-terminal binding protein 2) and histone acetyltransferase p300. Our in vitro data demonstrated that induction of CtBP2 by recombinant IL-1β (interleukin-1 beta) led to the upregulation of TGFB1 and the activation of TGF-β downstream signaling, while knockdown of CtBP2 resulted in the reversed effects. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we revealed that the CtBP2-p300-AP1 complex specifically bound to the promoter of TGFB and that knockdown or blockage of CtBP2 significantly decreased the occupancies of the p300 and AP-1 subunits. Our results support a model in which the CtBP2-p300-AP1 transcriptional complex activates the expression of TGFB1 , increasing its production and extracellular secretion. The secreted TGF-β binds to its receptors and initiates downstream signaling.\"\",Zhou Ping,International Journal of Biological Sciences,2020-01-01\n",

The progression of kidney diseases closely correlates with the accumulation of extracellular matrix leading to glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial injury. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta has been identified as a key mediator of kidney matrix accumulation. Overexpression of TGF-beta isoforms and their receptors was observed in a variety of renal diseases in both animals and humans. Given its crucial role in fibrotic kidney disease, TGF-beta has been recently considered as a possible target in the management of chronic renal diseases. This review discusses the role of TGF-beta in renal fibrosis and provides an overview of the strategies that, when interfering with TGF-beta expression and signalling, could be employed as new renoprotective treatments.\"\",Gagliardini Elena,Expert opinion on biological therapy,2007-02-21\n",
    "CSLY10,Oncoprotein DJ-1 interacts with mTOR complexes to effect transcription factor Hif1α-dependent expression of collagen I (α2) during renal fibrosis,\"\"No section Proximal tubular epithelial cells respond to transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) to synthesize collagen I (α2) during renal fibrosis. The oncoprotein DJ-1 has previously been shown to promote tumorigenesis and prevent apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons; however, its role in fibrosis signaling is unclear. Here, we show TGFβ-stimulation increased expression of DJ-1, which promoted noncanonical mTORC1 and mTORC2 activities. We show DJ-1 augmented the phosphorylation/activation of PKCβII, a direct substrate of mTORC2. In addition, coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed association of DJ-1 with Raptor and Rictor, exclusive subunits of mTORC1 and mTORC2, respectively, as well as with mTOR kinase. Interestingly, siRNAs against DJ-1 blocked TGFβ-stimulated expression of collagen I (α2), while expression of DJ-1 increased expression of this protein. In addition, expression of dominant negative PKCβII and siRNAs against PKCβII significantly inhibited TGFβ-induced collagen I (α2) expression. In fact, constitutively active PKCβII abrogated the effect of siRNAs against DJ-1, suggesting a role of PKCβII downstream of this oncoprotein. Moreover, we demonstrate expression of collagen I (α2) stimulated by DJ-1 and its target PKCβII is dependent on the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (Hif1α). Finally, we show in the renal cortex of diabetic rats that increased TGFβ was associated with enhanced expression of DJ-1 and activation of mTOR and PKCβII, concomitant with increased Hif1α and collagen I (α2). Overall, we identified that DJ-1 affects TGFβ-induced expression of collagen I (α2) via an mTOR-, PKCβII-, and Hif1α-dependent mechanism to regulate renal fibrosis.\"\",Das Falguni,The Journal of Biological Chemistry,2022-07-11\n",
    "CSLY11,Central role of dysregulation of TGF-β/Smad in CKD progression and potential targets of its treatment.,\"\"No section Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has emerged as a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Interstitial fibrosis, glomerulosclerosis and inflammation play the central role in the pathogenesis and progression of CKD to end stage renal disease (ESRD). Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is the central mediator of renal fibrosis and numerous studies have focused on inhibition of TGF-β1 and its downstream targets for treatment of kidney disease. However, blockade of TGF-β1 has not been effective in the treatment of CKD patients. This may be, in part due to anti-inflammatory effect of TGF-β1. The Smad signaling system plays a central role in regulation of TGF-β1 and TGF-β/Smad pathway plays a key role in progressive renal injury and inflammation. This review provides an overview of the role of TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis and inflammation and an effective target of anti-fibrotic therapies. Under pathological conditions, Smad2 and Smad3 expression are upregulated, while Smad7 is downregulated. In addition to TGF-β1, other pathogenic mediators such as angiotensin II and lipopolysaccharide activate Smad signaling through both TGF-β-dependent and independent pathways. Smads also interact with other pathways including nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) to regulate renal inflammation and fibrosis. In the context of renal fibrosis and inflammation, Smad3 exerts profibrotic effect, whereas Smad2 and Smad7 play renal protective roles. Smad4 performs its dual functions by transcriptionally promoting Smad3-dependent renal fibrosis but simultaneously suppressing NF-κB-mediated renal inflammation via Smad7-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, TGF-β1 induces Smad3 expression to regulate microRNAs and Smad ubiquitination regulatory factor (Smurf) to exert its pro-fibrotic effect. In conclusion, TGF-β/Smad signaling is an important pathway that mediates renal fibrosis and inflammation. Thus, an effective anti-fibrotic therapy via inhibition of Smad3 and upregulation of Smad7 signaling constitutes an attractive approach for treatment of CKD.\"\",Chen Lin,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2018-03-09\n",
    "CSLY12,Assessment of the Relationship Between Inflammation and Glomerular Filtration Rate,\"\"Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global health problem. As it progresses to end stages, renal replacement therapy is required but ultimately, the best treatment is transplantation. Decreased renal function has been associated with an inflammatory state associated to primary CKD and in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). Objective: To establish how the serum concentrations of some cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-2, IL-8, IL-22, IL-17α, interferon-gamma, IL-4, and transforming growth factor-β, correlate with various CKD stages. Methods: One hundred and forty-one KTRs between the ages of 18 and 75 years were included in the study. We also included 112 live kidney donors, 37 CKD PGCKD+3 , and 76 GPhealthy. Participants were grouped according to their glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and their circulating cytokine levels, previously quantified by ELISA. Results: By linear regression analysis, we established the relation of each cytokine with the GFR. Transforming growth factor-β correlated positively with the GFR in the study population, except in healthy individuals. A negative correlation of IL-8 and IL-17α and GFR was found in all cases. Conclusions: Whether these cytokines (IL-8 and IL-17α) could be used as inflammatory biomarkers indicating CKD progression, regardless of the type of population, remains to be prospectively determined.\"\",Ramirez-Gonzalez J.

    "CSLY13,TGF-β/Smad Signaling Pathway in Tubulointerstitial Fibrosis,\"\"No section Chronic kidney disease (CKD) was a major public health problem worldwide. Renal fibrosis, especially tubulointerstitial fibrosis, is final manifestation of CKD. Many studies have demonstrated that TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway plays a crucial role in renal fibrosis. Therefore, targeted inhibition of TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway can be used as a potential therapeutic measure for tubulointerstitial fibrosis. At present, a variety of targeting TGF-β1 and its downstream Smad proteins have attracted attention. Natural products used as potential therapeutic strategies for tubulointerstitial fibrosis have the characteristics of acting on multiple targets by multiple components and few side effects. With the continuous research and technique development, more and more molecular mechanisms of natural products have been revealed, and there are many natural products that inhibited tubulointerstitial fibrosis via TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway. This review summarized the role of TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway in tubulointerstitial fibrosis and natural products against tubulointerstitial fibrosis by targeting TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway.

    "CSLY14,\"\"AKI on CKD: heightened injury, suppressed repair, and the underlying mechanisms.\"\",\"\"No section Acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are interconnected. Although AKI-to-CKD transition has been intensively studied, the information of AKI on CKD is very limited. Nonetheless, AKI, when occurring in patients with CKD, is known to be more severe and difficult to recover. CKD is associated with significant changes in cell signaling in kidney tissues, including the activation of transforming growth factor-β, p53, hypoxia-inducible factor, and major developmental pathways. At the cellular level, CKD is characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and aberrant autophagy. At the tissue level, CKD is characterized by chronic inflammation and vascular dysfunction. These pathologic changes may contribute to the heightened sensitivity of, and nonrecovery from, AKI in patients with CKD.\"\",He Liyu,Kidney international,2017-09-08\n",
    "CSLY15,Leptospirosis kidney disease: Evolution from acute to chronic kidney disease,\"\"No section Leptospirosis is a neglected bacterial disease caused by leptospiral infection that carries a substantial mortality risk in severe cases. Research has shown that acute, chronic, and asymptomatic leptospiral infections are closely linked to acute and chronic kidney disease (CKD) and renal fibrosis. Leptospires affect renal function by infiltrating kidney cells via the renal tubules and interstitium and surviving in the kidney by circumventing the immune system. The most well-known pathogenic molecular mechanism of renal tubular damage caused by leptospiral infection is the direct binding of the bacterial outer membrane protein LipL32 to toll-like receptor-2 expressed in renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs) to induce intracellular inflammatory signaling pathways. These pathways include the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- and nuclear factor kappa activation, resulting in acute and chronic leptospirosis-related kidney injury. Few studies have investigated the relationship between acute and chronic renal diseases and leptospirosis and further evidence is necessary. In this review, we intend to discuss the roles of acute kidney injury (AKI) to/on CKD in leptospirosis. This study reviews the molecular pathways underlying the pathogenesis of leptospirosis kidney disease, which will assist in concentrating on potential future research directions.\"\",Chou Li-Fang,Biomedical Journal,2023-05-02\n",
    "CSLY16,National trends and projection of chronic kidney disease incidence according to etiology from 1990 to 2030 in Iran: a Bayesian age-period-cohort modeling study,\"\"OBJECTIVES Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health problem worldwide. Predicting CKD incidence rates and case numbers at the national and global levels is vital for planning CKD prevention programs. METHODS Data on CKD incidence rates and case numbers in Iran from 1990 to 2019 were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease online database. The average annual percentage change was computed to determine the temporal trends in CKD age-standardized incidence rates from 1990 to 2019. A Bayesian age-period-cohort model was used to predict the CKD incidence rate and case numbers through 2030. RESULTS Nationally, CKD cases increased from 97,300 in 1990 to 315,500 in 2019. The age-specific CKD incidence rate increased from 168.52 per 100,000 to 382.98 per 100,000 during the same period. Between 2020 and 2030, the number of CKD cases is projected to rise to 423,300. The age-specific CKD incidence rate is projected to increase to 469.04 in 2030 (95% credible interval, 399.20 to 538.87). In all age groups and etiological categories, the CKD incidence rate is forecasted to increase by 2030. CONCLUSIONS CKD case numbers and incidence rates are anticipated to increase in Iran through 2030. The high level of CKD incidence in people with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and glomerulonephritis, as well as in older people, suggests a deficiency of attention to these populations in current prevention plans and highlights their importance in future programs for the national control of CKD.\"\",Shahbazi Fatemeh,Epidemiology and Health,2023-02-17\n",

Due to the disease itself or other accompanying health issues such as hypertension and nephron loss due to aging, a significant number of patients end up with kidney disease. The current research aimed to analyze the concentration of cytokines in the serum (Interleukin [IL]-18, IL-17a and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-) in Iraqi adult patients with diabetic kidney disease (DKD). The current investigation was carried out in Tikrit Teaching Hospital/Salahaddin governorate for the time from October 2022 to January 2023. Sixty blood specimens were obtained from patients with DKD. Serum levels of IL-18, IL-17a, and TGF- markers in the samples were subjected to measurement by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results of the present study showed significant differences (P &lt; 0.05) among different age categories of clinical populations with 51-60 and &gt;60 years scoring highest (28% and 33%), whereas 21-30 and 31-40 years scored (8.3% and 13.3%). The concentration of IL-18, IL-17a, and TGF- markers was high in patients (200.30 59.50, 102.13 50.82, and 57.15 18.90) than in healthy individuals (104.50 31.01, 42.90 10.55, and 31.90 8.83). Based on the Pearson's correlation results, IL-17a had a significant negative correlation with TGF- (r = 0.270* Sig. =0.037). Moreover, the receiver operating characteristic curve showed the IL-18, IL-17a, and TGF- markers scored the highest sensitivity (98%, 96%, and 87%) and specificity (94%, 97%, and 80%), respectively, in screening patients with DKD. Based on the analysis, it could be inferred that disease intensity generally tends to worsen with an increase in age. IL-18, IL-17a, and TGF- are good prognostic markers in screening patients with DKD. These cytokines present a promising target for therapeutic interventions in DKD therapy.\"\",Mezher Maysam Adnan,Journal of Advanced Pharmaceutical Technology & Research,2023-01-01\n",

We conducted a nested case-control study in 348 subjects (116 cases and 232 controls) from the “Tianjin Medical University Chronic Diseases Cohort”. All subjects did not have CKD at baseline, and they were followed up for 5 years until August 2018. Using multivariate Cox regression analysis, we found five nongenetic risk factors associated with CKD risks. Logistic regression was performed to select single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from which we obtained from GWAS analysis of the UK Biobank and other databases. We used a logistic regression model and natural logarithm OR value weighting to establish CKD genetic/nongenetic risk prediction models. In addition, the final comprehensive prediction model is the arithmetic sum of the two optimal models. The AUC of the prediction model reached 0.894, while the sensitivity was 0.827, and the specificity was 0.801. We found that age, diabetes, and normal high values of urea nitrogen, TGF-β, and ADMA were independent risk factors for CKD.

    "CSLY20,Chronic Kidney Disease-Induced Vascular Calcification Impairs Bone Metabolism,\"\"No section An association between lower bone mineral density (BMD) and presence of vascular calcification (VC) has been reported in several studies. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) causes detrimental disturbances in the mineral balance, bone turnover, and development of severe VC. Our group has previously demonstrated expression of Wnt inhibitors in calcified arteries of CKD rats. Therefore, we hypothesized that the CKD‐induced VC via this pathway signals to bone and induces bone loss. To address this novel hypothesis, we developed a new animal model using isogenic aorta transplantation (ATx). Severely calcified aortas from uremic rats were transplanted into healthy rats (uremic ATx). Transplantation of normal aortas into healthy rats (normal ATx) and age‐matched rats (control) served as control groups. Trabecular tissue mineral density, as measured by μCT, was significantly lower in uremic ATx rats compared with both control groups. Uremic ATx rats showed a significant upregulation of the mineralization inhibitors osteopontin and progressive ankylosis protein homolog in bone. In addition, we found significant changes in bone mRNA levels of several genes related to extracellular matrix, bone turnover, and Wnt signaling in uremic ATx rats, with no difference between normal ATx and control. The bone histomorphometry analysis showed significant lower osteoid area in uremic ATx compared with normal ATx along with a trend toward fewer osteoblasts as well as more osteoclasts in the erosion lacunae. Uremic ATx and normal ATx had similar trabecular number and thickness. The bone formation rate did not differ between the three groups. Plasma biochemistry, including sclerostin, kidney, and mineral parameters, were similar between all three groups. ex vivo cultures of aorta from uremic rats showed high secretion of the Wnt inhibitor sclerostin. In conclusion, the presence of VC lowers BMD, impairs bone metabolism, and affects several pathways in bone. The present results prove the existence of a vasculature to bone tissue cross‐talk. © 2020 The Authors.
